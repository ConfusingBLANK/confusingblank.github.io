# PE File Format Essentials

My notes on the PE file format as I go through the Sektor 7 Malware Course.

Important Concepts
File Pointer: An offset within the disk. The location of an item within the file itself, before being processed by the linker (in the case of object files) or the loader (in the case of image files). In other words, this is a position within the file as stored on disk.

Relative Virtual Address (RVA): In an image file, this is the address of an item after it is loaded into memory, with the base address of the image file subtracted from it. The RVA of an item almost always differs from its position within the file on disk (file pointer).
In an object file, an RVA is less meaningful because memory locations are not assigned. In this case, an RVA would be an address within a section (described later in this table), to which a relocation is later applied during linking. For simplicity, a compiler should just set the first RVA in each section to zero.
