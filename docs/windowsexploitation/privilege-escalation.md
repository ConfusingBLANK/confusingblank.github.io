# Windows Privilege Escalation Techniques

## Searching for sensitive filles

Start by searching for sensitive files on the local C drive. After that search any reachable network shares. [SharpShares](https://github.com/mitchmoser/SharpShares) can be used to search for open network shares.

```
dir /b /a /s c:\ > c-dirs.txt
```

```
SharpShares.exe /ldap:all /filter:sysvol,netlogon,ipc$,print$

```

Either extract the c-dirs.txt file onto your system and use your tool/text editor of choice to search for sensitive file. If you prefer to stay on the windows system and search through the file, use `type` and `findstr` to search for sensitive string.

```
type c:\rto\c-dirs.txt | findstr /i passw
```
